Very original title, I know.

<p>This is largely just to force myself to get started on this new project.<br>
While I'm not entirely sure of the direction I will take this in the future,
it will begin with updates on getting the website started, as well as my progress adding and updating my GitHub repositories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So far most of the work has been editing lots of filler text contained in the website theme and generally personalising everything. I have added details to the about section as well as settling on the general layout of the website and, with this, added my first post.<br>
Upcoming posts will be made for projects I choose to showcase on the website.</p>

<p>Once everything is up and running, I'll be posting about software testing and related topics, as well as talking about my coding journey.</p>

I hope you stay around for future updates.<br>
Sam
