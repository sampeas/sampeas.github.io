Very original title, I know.

<p>This is largely just to force myself to get started on this new project.<br>
I'm not entirely sure what direction I will take this in the future but for now it will mostly include updates to the site itself, as well as my progress adding and updating my GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Once everything is up and running, I'll be posting about software testing and related topics, as well as talking about my coding journey.</p>

I hope you stay around for future updates.<br>
Sam
