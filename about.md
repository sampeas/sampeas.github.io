### About Me
I am a ISTQBÂ® <abbr title="Certified Tester Foundation Level">CTFL</abbr> certified QA Engineer working on web and desktop applications. My work includes writing and maintaining REST api tests in Postman, as well as manual tetsing using test cases and exlporatory testing methods

Currently I am working on improving my C# coding abilities by writing tests against a DLL of api endpoints. I also work on personal projects outside of work that are documented on this website.
