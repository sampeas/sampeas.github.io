### About Me
I am a QA Engineer working on web and desktop applications. One of my main responsibilities is writing and maintaining REST api tests in Postman. I have also spent time writing automated UI browsere tests using Katalon Studio.

Currently I am working on improving my C# coding abilities by writing tests against a DLL of api endpoints. I also work on personal projects outside of work that are documented on this website.
